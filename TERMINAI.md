GPT
Here's the updated terminai.md documentation including the MASTERMIND modular extension to reflect the integration of a complex command and AI interaction system:

TerminAI
TerminAI is an innovative Python application that merges the power of OpenAI's GPT models with the versatility of the command-line interface. This allows users to interact with advanced AI directly from their terminal and execute shell commands within the same context, augmented by the MASTERMIND modular extension for enhanced command processing and AI capabilities.

Features
AI Integration: Engage with OpenAI's GPT models for dynamic conversations.
Command Execution: Seamlessly execute shell commands by prefixing with cmd:.
Secure API Key Management: Automates the secure storage of your OpenAI API key for repeated use.
MASTERMIND Extension: Integrates complex decision-making and command execution strategies using the MASTERMIND framework.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
An active internet connection
An OpenAI API key (obtainable from OpenAI)
Installation
Clone the repository or download TerminAI.py directly to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash'''
pip install requests
# Note: curses is included in the standard library for Unix-based systems. Windows users might need windows-curses, installable via pip.
Configuration
On the first run, you will be prompted to enter your OpenAI API key. This key will be stored locally in a .env file for future use, ensuring your sessions remain seamless.

Running TerminAI
Navigate to the directory containing TerminAI.py and execute:

```bash'''
python3 TerminAI.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to start interacting with the AI or execute commands.

Usage
AI Interaction: Simply type your query and press Enter to receive a response from the AI.
Executing Commands: Type cmd: followed by your command to execute it within the terminal.
Exiting: Type exit to terminate the session.
Security
The .env file containing your OpenAI API key is stored locally. Ensure it is securely managed and not exposed to unauthorized parties.
Exercise caution when executing shell commands, especially those suggested by AI or from untrusted sources, to mitigate potential security risks.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, particularly with the curses interface, consider trying a different terminal emulator or adjusting your terminal settings. For connectivity issues, verify your internet connection and firewall settings.
